        <h3>Why Amsterdam?</h3>
        <div class="cap-city">
          Amsterdam is the capital city of the Netherlands
        </div>
        <br />
        <p class="text">
          It is known for its artistic heritage, elaborate canal system and
          narrow houses with gabled facades, legacies of the city’s 17th-century
          Golden Age. Its Museum District houses the Van Gogh Museum, works by
          Rembrandt and Vermeer at the Rijksmuseum, and modern art at the
          Stedelijk. Cycling is key to the city’s character, and there are
          numerous bike paths.
